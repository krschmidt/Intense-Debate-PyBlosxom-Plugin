PyBlosxom Plugin for IntenseDebate (http://intensedebate.com/)

IntenseDebate is a comment service which provides advanced utilities 
for managing comments including threading, approval, spam checking, and more.

PyBlosxom is a Python Blogging program with extensive customization and plugin
capacities.

To use:
Add the variable intense_debate_id to your config.py file, where your id
is the long string after idcomments_acct in the javascript IntenseDebate
gives you. Then simply put the variable $intenseDebate where you want 
your comments to appear.

You can also use the variable $commentCount to get a count of the number of
comments in the story, but this variable will only be populated if we're
looking at a single story. Finding the number of comments for each story
while looking at a collection of stories is beyond my current understanding of
PyBlosxom.
